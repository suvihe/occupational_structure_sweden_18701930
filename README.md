This data includes all census occupations from Swedish population censuses 1870 - 1930. The original census occupations have been standardized and coded to HISCO manually. 
The HISCO codes were decided based on matches either directly from the Swedish occupational title or through translated occupational title. I am grateful for Christer Lundh for sharing his coding, which I used to cross-check my own coding.
I will add an appendix explaining the coding behind the dataset soon.
